State:
- Played on a 6x6 matrix
- Each element on the matrix can only have 2 states, "popped" or "not-popped"

Game Steps:
- Player 1 chooses a row
- Player one decides how many elements to pop on that row
	NOTE
	- Can only popped unpopped elements
	- Can only pop elements on the chosen row
	- The order in which the pops are popped or the positions (cols) of each pop is disregarded, as it does not change the game state in any way
	EG:
		OOXOXO
		OOOOOO
		OOOOOO
		OOOOOO
		OOOOOO
		OOOOOO

	is the same as:
		XXOOOO
		OOOOOO
		OOOOOO
		OOOOOO
		OOOOOO
		OOOOOO

- After popping the elements on the chosen row, switch to player 2
- Repeat until there is one "not-popped" element left
	NOTE
	- This is known as "checkmate"
	- Whoever made the last move wins
	- There aren't any draws
